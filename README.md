# QR Code Reader Chrome Extension

QR Code Reader Chrome Extension

## Features

1. While hovering over a QR Code image / canvas html element, it will show a hover popup that displays the content of the QR Code.
2. While the hovering popup is active, the user can press Ctrl C to copy the content to the user's clipboard, or press enter to open the link (if it's a link, otherwise it'll just copy to clipboard) in a new tab.

## Issues

1. If the hover popup is overlapping the QR Code, then stuttering might occur, due to the popup being repeatedly moved into view and out of view.
2. Not all QR Code can be detected.
3. Positioning of popups is a bit awkward ~~(and i dont feel like fixing it)~~, especially for QR Code shown on image html element.
